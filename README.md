## What is it

It's some short CSS for Stylus that hides videos locked behind a paywall. Some people are poor, Karen

## What is a Stylus

It's a browser extension that allows you to use CSS to modify the appearance of webpages

## How do I install it

Click on hide_member_videos.user.css in the repo files, then click Raw at the top-right (or alternatively just [click this link](https://github.com/FCE300/stylus_HideYouTubeMembersOnly/raw/refs/heads/main/hide_member_videos.user.css) to be taken straight to it) and Stylus should automatically bring to you a page with an "Install" button on the left

## Disclaimer

I create CSS via screaming and throwing myself at a wall repeatedly until something happens so I can't promise that I can fix it if something breaks
